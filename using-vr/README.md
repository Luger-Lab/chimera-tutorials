# Using virtual reality in Chimerax

>This step by step guide should allow you to visualize your structures in virtual reality with the Oculus Rift on your lab visulization station.

0. Start up the Visualization Station and log in (login information is on desk)
1. Open up ChimeraX (usually v1.1 although the daily build may have functions that you want).
2. Open the pdb or session you want to look at.
    - command line:
    >open <pdbID>
    - File > open 
3. Put structure in display that you want, I tend to do the following:
    - Hide atoms
    - Show ribbons 
    - White background 
    - Soft lighting 
    - You can also add a surface and change the transparency to ~40%
4. On the desktop open the Oculus App (leave open in background).
5. Take the Oculus out of the cabinet and plug the display port (like HMDI) into the back of the PC, next to HMDI port.
6. Plug in USB into one of the open USB ports in the back. 
7. The Oculus should connect automatically (you can check by going into the Oculus App and clicking on the 'Devices' tab).
8. The Oculus is now connected, if you know how to use it continue to next step, if not:
    - Go into the Oculus App
    - Click 'Library'
    - Click 'Oculus First Steps'
    - This should acquaint you with the Oculus, if not contact Shawn.
9. Back in ChimeraX, type 'vr on' into the command line and press enter.
10. You can now put the Oculus on and you should be in VR.
    - Hopefully the guardian boundary is set up, if not it will walk through how to set it up.
    - The yellow and blue cones are your controllers, blue should be right, yellow is left. You want the side triggers to be on the insides of the controllers.
    - Holding one inside trigger will allow you to move the whole scene with that hand. 
    - Hodling both inside triggers and moving the controllers closer together or further apart with resize the structure. 
    - The index finger triggers are selection tools.
    - The joysticks on either controller can also be used for navigation. 
    - If you look at the rest of the cone, you will see a map of all the buttons you have available.
    - You can bring up the menu (one of the thumb buttons on your right hand), this will allow you to use other actions. 
    - You can go to the 'Right Mouse' menu to remap any button on your controller, simply point at the new function you want if your cone and press the button you'd like to remap as that function.
11. When done, take off the Oculus and execute the command 'vr off'.
12. Unplug the Oculus and put it back in the cabinet.
13. Close all of the programs you opened.
